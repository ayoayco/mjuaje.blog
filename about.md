You're probably wondering how to pronounce my last name. It's waaa-he. It rhymes with water, and not with wage.

I teach civil engineering in the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os. I grew up in a Christian home, almost turned back on the faith after graduating, but was persistently pursued by our Creator. I then had a renewed hunger for the Word of God, almost as if that was just the first time that the New Testament made sense to me. I was blind, but now I see and understand.

I am an active member of Christ's Commission Fellowship, but am not in anyway representing my church nor their views. I am solely responsible for the content of this site. I also don't hold any leadership position in my church aside from being a small group leader; therefore I consider myself a **layman**.

I wholeheartedly subscribe to the historic doctrines of the Protestant faith which can be summarized by the Five Solas:

- *Sola Gratia* (Grace Alone)
- *Sola Fide* (Faith Alone)
- *Solus Christus* (Christ Alone)
- *Sola Scriptura* (Scripture Alone)
- *Soli Deo Gloria* (For the Glory of God Alone)

When it comes to less essential matters, I subscribe closest to the following positions:

- Reformed soteriology
- Cessationism
- Complementarianism
- Credobaptism

I did not indicate these positions to discriminate other genuine Christians who hold different views, but just to share some context on my articles, as well as to provide transparency. In fact, I have close friends who do not hold these less essential doctrines, whom I consider brothers and sisters in the faith.

I did not (or have not yet) have seminary education. But just to appeal to some sort of credibility, let me share my favorite books:

- *The Holiness of God* by R. C. Sproul
- *Knowing God* by J. I. Packer
- *Mere Christianity* by C. S. Lewis
- *The Problem of Pain* by C. S. Lewis
- *Desiring God* by John Piper
